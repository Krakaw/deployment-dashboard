# deployment-dashboard
Aggregate and generate data for deployments

## General idea
 * Show PR's pending
 * Show current versions of services
 * Show closed issues / PR titles between deployments
   - So that we can see what is going to be pushed up
 * Show if any of the PR diffs include a migration
 * Aggregate who wants the deployment to go forward
 * Have a 1-click deploy?
 * Get "sign-offs" on deploying or block deploy
